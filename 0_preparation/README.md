# Preparing for the CIML Summer Institute

**SESSION:** 0_preparation

## Instructions:
You will get the most out of the CIML Summer Institute if you are prepared prior to the event. By brushing up on your knowledge of Linux and installing all necessary software on your laptop before to the event, you’ll be able to focus your attention on the skills and topics that are most relevant to high performance and data intensive computing.

To help you get the most out of this workshop, this section contains a set of detailed start-up instructions, beginning with setting up your account and connecting to Expanse, to configuring your laptop for running visualization software. Please read the documents and exercises carefully, and complete all necessary steps before event. Feel free to ask questions or if you have any problems with the start-up tasks

##  Accounts: <a name="accounts"></a>
* We have created TWO types of accounts for you: (1) XSEDE and Expanse portal ID; (2) Local Expanse user account.
* This section will be covered on day 1 (prep day) (1.2 Accounts, Login, Environment, Running Jobs and Logging into Expanse User Portal).

### Logging onto the Expanse Portal: <a name="logon-portal"></a>
* XSEDE training accounts to access the Expanse portal have already been created for you. Please do not create a new one on your own. Refer to email fron cwong@sdsc.edu for your XSEDE & Expanse acount "CIML 2022 Summer Institute: Account Set-Up". 
* Once you have received your XSEDE and Expanse portal ID information, please go to https://portal.expanse.sdsc.edu, to confirm your login.


### Logging onto Expanse using your "Local Expanse user account": <a name="logon-expanse"></a>
* You will be given an account on the SDSC Expanse computer. Information on the account will be sent to you via email. Please complete the process of activating your account before the institute begins.

 ## Computer and Laptop Set-up: <a name="computer-req"></a>
* We recommend a second screen for the hands-on sessions. The first to view the presentation, the second for hands-on.
* After you access your account information, confirm that you can login (SSH) to Expanse using the device you plan to use during the CIML Summer Institute (laptop, workstation, etc...).  Detailed instructions on connecting to Expanse using SSH can be found [here](https://github.com/sdsc-hpc-training-org/basic_skills/tree/master/connecting-to-hpc-systems).  

It has been suggested that a second monitor may be helpful during online instruction.  While one monitor could be used to follow instruction, the other for the hands-on.  Additionally, the use of a mouse may be beneficial as well during some sessions.
