# Preparing for the CIML Summer Institute

**SESSION:** 0_preparation

## Instructions:
You will get the most out of the CIML Summer Institute if you are prepared prior to the event. By brushing up on your knowledge of Linux and installing all necessary software on your laptop before to the event, you’ll be able to focus your attention on the skills and topics that are most relevant to high performance and data intensive computing.

To help you get the most out of this workshop, this section contains a set of detailed start-up instructions, beginning with setting up your account and connecting to Expanse, to configuring your laptop for running visualization software. Please read the documents and exercises carefully, and complete all necessary steps before event. Feel free to ask questions or if you have any problems with the start-up tasks

##  HPC Systems Accounts: <a name="accounts"></a>
* For the CIML Institute, we have created TWO types of **Training** accounts for you: 
  * **(1) XSEDE and Expanse portal ID**
  * **(2) Local Expanse user account**
* Note: The two topics below will be covered on the Preparation day (1.2 Accounts, Login, Environment, Running Jobs and Logging into Expanse User Portal).

### Logging onto the Expanse Portal: <a name="logon-portal"></a>
* XSEDE training accounts to access the Expanse portal have already been created for you. Please do not create a new one on your own. See email sent from cwong@sdsc.edu for your XSEDE & Expanse acount with the subject link "CIML 2022 Summer Institute: Account Set-Up". 
* Once you have received your XSEDE and Expanse portal ID information, go to https://portal.expanse.sdsc.edu, to confirm your login.
* For a short (18 min) video on using the Expanse portal, see [here](https://education.sdsc.edu/training/interactive/sdsc_si21/1.3_Expanse_User_Portal/).

### Logging onto Expanse using your "Local Expanse user account": <a name="logon-expanse"></a>
* You will be given an account on the SDSC Expanse computer. Information on the account will be sent to you via email. Please complete the process of activating your account before the institute begins. To log onto the Expase cluster, see these instructions: https://github.com/sdsc-hpc-training-org/hpc-security/blob/master/connecting-to-hpc-systems/connect-to-expanse.md

### Basic Skills <a name="basic-skills"></a>
There are several basic skills needed in order to access and run jobs on HPC systems. There are two GitHub repositories with several mini-tutorials that you can access:
* Basic HPC Linx Skills: https://github.com/sdsc-hpc-training-org/basic_skills
* HPC Security:  https://github.com/sdsc-hpc-training-org/hpc-security

In particular, we suggest that you review the following: 
* Connecting to Expanse: https://github.com/sdsc-hpc-training-org/hpc-security/blob/master/connecting-to-hpc-systems/connect-to-expanse.md
* Basic_Linux_Skills on Expanse: [https://github.com/sdsc/sdsc-summer-institute-2020/tree/master/0_preparation/basic_linux_skills](https://github.com/sdsc-hpc-training-org/basic_skills/tree/master/basic_linux_skills_expanse)
  
**TBD**
* Interactive Computing](https://github.com/sdsc-hpc-training-org/basic_skills/tree/master/interactive_computing)
* How to Run Notebooks on Expanse](https://github.com/sdsc-hpc-training-org/basic_skills/tree/master/how_to_run_notebooks_on_expanse)

##  Remote access via Zoom, Slack, and GitHub <a name="remote"></a>

* For the institute, we will coordinate our remote access via Zoom, Slack, and GitHub
* When setting up your “display name” on Zoom & Slack, please list your FIRST name, LAST name, and institution (i.e., Jane Doe (SDSC))

### Zoom:  <a name="zoom"></a>
 You will need to install the latest [Zoom](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/zoom.us/download__;!!Mih3wA!UGXaOZYQHBMwc07Vt0SbIo6BuDVjS0wz54dT6sb7Q9QMDnX831-1_4ewcxi5fw$) client, which is available for Windows, MacOS and Linux, Once installed, you can test your microphone and camera interface with Zoom here. You can find more information on Zoom system requirements, including bandwidth requirements here.  

To ensure the security of our Zoom links, details will be sent to all participants just prior to preparation day (June 18) and again prior to CIML Summer Institute week (June 22-24).  Zoom details for all sessions will be unique.

### Slack:  <a name="slack"></a>
* We will also be using Slack as our main platform for announcements, where participants can communicate and ask for help. Download ([Windows](https://slack.com/downloads/windows), [MacOS](https://slack.com/downloads/mac), or [Linux](https://slack.com/downloads/linux)) and [get started](https://slack.com/help/articles/218080037-Getting-started-for-new-Slack-users). Zoom chat will be disabled. Make sure to turn on your notifications to receive alerts. 
  
You should have access to THREE channels:
* General: This channel will be used for announcements, team-wide conversations, and any questions during sessions. For assistance with your account, go to #help-desk channel 
* Help-desk: This channel will be used to troubleshoot any issues related to account access or login 
* Introduce-yourself: With everyone attending virtually, getting the opportunity to introduce each other is hard. Please use this space to introduce yourself, so we can get to know each other.
  
* When setting up your “display name” on Zoom & Slack, please list your FIRST name, LAST name, and institution (i.e., Jane Doe (SDSC))

### Github: <a name="github"></a>
* Most of the training material will be located on the CIML Summer Institute GitHub repo and one of the Thursday hands-on sessions will require a GitHub account. 
* If you do not already have one, you can create a free personal GitHub account [here](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/signing-up-for-github/signing-up-for-a-new-github-account).  
* For basic GitHub usage on SDSC systems, see here: https://github.com/sdsc-hpc-training-org/basic_skills/tree/master/using_github
